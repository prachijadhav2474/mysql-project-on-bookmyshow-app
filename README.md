# mysql-project-on-bookmyshow-app
Creating a MySQL project for a BookMyShow-like application involves designing a database to manage information related to movies, theaters, bookings, users, and other relevant entities. This project aims to develop a simplified version of an online movie ticket booking system inspired by BookMyShow. The system allows users to browse movies, view showtimes, book tickets, and manage bookings seamlessly. It leverages MySQL for database management.

Database Schema
The database schema includes tables for users, movies, theaters, showtimes, bookings, and possibly additional entities depending on the project's requirements.

Users: Stores user information including username, email, and password.
Movies: Contains details about available movies such as title, genre, and release date.
Theaters: Stores information about theaters including name and location.
Showtimes: Represents specific showtimes for movies in theaters, including start time and end time.
Bookings: Tracks bookings made by users, including the number of tickets, total amount, and booking time.
30 SQL Questions
Below are 30 SQL questions related to the BookMyShow project, covering various aspects of the system's functionality and database operations:

Consider the movies table for generating 10 questions: -

Question 1: Retrieve the titles of all movies in the database. Question 2: Find the genres of movies released on or after a specific date. Question 3: Identify the number of movies in each genre. Question 4: List the movies released before a certain year. Question 5: Find the most recent movie in the database. Question 6: Count the total number of movies in the database. Question 7: Display the titles and release dates of movies. Question 8: Retrieve the titles of movies that belong to a specific genre. Question 9: Identify the oldest movie in the database. Question 10: List the titles of movies along with their respective genres.

These questions cover various aspects of querying the movies table, such as selecting specific columns, filtering based on conditions, and aggregating data.

Consider the relationship between the movies and showtimes tables for generating 10 questions: -

Question 1: Retrieve the titles and genres of all movies that have showtimes. Question 2: Find the theaters where a specific movie is currently being shown. Question 3: Identify the number of showtimes for each movie. Question 4: List the movies playing in a particular theater. Question 5: Find the start times of all showtimes for a specific movie.

Question 9: List the movies along with the corresponding theater locations Question 10: Find the total number of tickets booked for each movie.

These questions involve queries that require joining the movies and showtimes tables to gather information from both tables.

Consider a relationship between the movies, showtimes, and bookings tables for generating 10 questions:
